# Learning themes

1.  I can't teach you React -- I don't know it well enough to teach it, but I can give you some tips.

2.  Pick something a little more complex, workflow-wise, than
a todo list.  Making fun, sometimes silly apps that have just a tiny
bit more complexity outside your comfort zone are perfect for learning.  Entertaining your friends and family with silly sites
is a great motivator to continue learning.   Whatever you are passionate about (jokes/quizzes, mortgages, math, the monty hall problem) -- think of something you can build the logic for in an hour or so and then spend 2-3 hours on the React layer over it.

3.  Fonts, colors, and margins matter, so use bootstrap and customize it.  There's no point in having a slick, responsive UI if the spacing, colors, and general UI style look like a Word-doc saved as HTML in 1996. **React is also often very CSS heavy.**  Not being comfortable with CSS will be a roadblock to learning, so get in front of it.

4.  Think about things like data validation and initialization --
they're not as obvious with hooks.

5.  Think with a component in mind -- use props.  Even if you aren't
publishing a package -- can you extract your component and put it
into another web-page?  If not, why not?

5.  More on props -- have a data source format for your props,
even if there's no back end--even if it's just a JSON or JavaScript object.  This help you keep props and initial state in mind 
and make further composition or API-driven components easier late.

6.  Using eslint will teach you a *lot* about correct React style and will get you in the habit of destructuring objects, using
fat arrows, and other modern JavaScript habits.  Try using a style guide from eslint --init you aren't familiar with, like one from Google or GitHub.
Even if you disable some of the warnings later, you'll be exposed to a lot.

7.  Small, subtle touches, such as hiding UI when not needed, often can be done with conditional rendering, so get some practice
doing this.  There are lots of ways to hide HTML -- but if the hiding is tied to react-logic, conditional rendering is often the way to go.

8.  Try on mobile regularly.  Better yet, have a friend or family member try on mobile regularly.  If "OnClick" and "OnMouseOver" cause
non-intitive behavior on someone's phone -- time to learn some more UI.  I text my wife on the other side of the couch with:
http://10.0.197:3000 all the time with my latest silly app, and if she smiles and gets it, I know I'm doing something right.
