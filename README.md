# Learning themes

1.  Pick something a little more complex, workflow-wise, than
a todo list.  Making fun, sometimes silly apps that have just a tiny
bit more complexity outside your comfort zone are perfect for learning.  Entertaining your friends and family with silly sites
is a great motivator.

2.  Fonts, colors, and margins matter, so use bootstrap and customize it.  There's no point in having a slick, responsive UI if the spacing, colors, and general UI style look like a Word-doc saved
as HTML in 1996.

3.  Think about things like data validation and initialization --
they're not as obvious with hooks.

4.  Think with a component in mind -- use props.  Even if you aren't
publishing a package -- can you extract your component and put it
into another web-page?  If not, why not?

5.  Have a data source format for your props,
even if there's no back end, even if it's just a JSON or JavaScript object.

6.  eslint will teach you a *lot* about correct React style
and will get you in the habit of destructuring objects, using
fat arrows, and other modern JavaScript habits.

7.  Small, subtle touches, such as hiding UI when not needed,
often can be done with conditional rendering, so get some practice
doing this.

8.  Try on mobile regularly.  Better yet, have a friend or family member try on mobile regularly.  If "OnClick" and "OnMouseOver" cause
non-intitive behavior on your roommate's phone -- time to learn some
more UI.
